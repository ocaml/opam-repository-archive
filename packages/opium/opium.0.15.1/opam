synopsis: "Sinatra like web toolkit based on Lwt + Cohttp"
description: """
Opium is a minimalistic library for quickly binding functions
to http routes. Its features include (but not limited to):

* Middleware system for app independent components
* A simple router for matching urls and parsing parameters
* Request/Response pretty printing for easier debugging

Note: This library is still at an early stage so expect breakages
until 1.0"""

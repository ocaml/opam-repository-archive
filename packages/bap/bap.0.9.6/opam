synopsis: "Binary Analysis Platform"
description: """
BAP is platform for binary analysis. It provides an OCaml library, 
a set of tools and Python bindings. It also has a JSON API, exposed with 
bap-server utility.

BAP uses LLVM library as a disassembling backend, and provide facilities to
parse files in ELF, MACH-O, COFF and PE formats. It has a basic support for 
all LLVM architectures, but first tier platforms are:

  - ARM
  - IA32 aka x86
  - AMD64 aka x86-64"""

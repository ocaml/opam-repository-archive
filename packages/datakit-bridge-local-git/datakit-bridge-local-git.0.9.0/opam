synopsis: "DataKit Local-Git bridge"
description: """
This service is a drop-in replacement for the DataKit-GitHub bridge
that instead just monitors a local Git repository. It is useful for
testing a new DataKitCI configuration without having to configure
GitHub integration first.

The local bridge monitors the state of one or more local Git
repositories, writing the current head of each branch to
DataKit. DataKitCI can be configured to run the CI tests against the
project each time a commit is made.

Once you are happy with the way the CI is working, you can replace
this service with the GitHub bridge service to have the CI test a
project hosted on GitHub instead.

Unlike the GitHub bridge, this service:

- only reports on branches, not tags or pull requests;
- does not report build statuses from other CI systems; and
- does not push the statuses set by the CI anywhere."""

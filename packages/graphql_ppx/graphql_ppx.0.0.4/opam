synopsis: "GraphQL syntax extension for Bucklescript/ReasonML"
description: """
This library lets you construct type-safe and validated queries at compile time,
and generates response validation code for you. If you're writing a Bucklescript
app that talks to a GraphQL server, this library will cut down on the
boilerplate you have to write."""
